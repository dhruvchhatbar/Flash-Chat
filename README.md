Flashchat App

This app has Firebase Authentication (email & phone) as secured access and
has been designed dynamically so that it can support various devices, via AutoLayout ,
Structural array is used as it has a great role to read & write different dataâ€™s of user with the help of Getter and Setter,
It was a challenge to show data just in a way that all messaging app has, but TableViewDelegates and Datasources was that key,
Have used ARKit in it, to develop a filter similar to Snapchat Bitmoji filter.
With the help of local database like Core Data and UserDefaults , user data was stored in a secured format.
